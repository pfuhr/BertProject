# BertProject
This is the github repository for a small Machine Learning project of Paul Fuhr. The task was effectively to map snippets of text (provided in arguments.tsv) to 20-dimensional binary vectors (provided in labels-level2.tsv). The code for Model architecture, Training and Evaluation can be found in TC.ipynb.
